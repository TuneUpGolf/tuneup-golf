        <h1>Store Terms and Conditions</h1>
        
        <h2>Second: Conditions for Customer Registration in the Store</h2>
        <p>The customer must be of full legal capacity and over 18 years of age, and the customer acknowledges that they are of full legal capacity.</p>
        
        <p>The customer undertakes to provide the store with correct information and data required to benefit from the services and purchase from the store.</p>
        
        <p>The customer is prohibited from taking any action that may lead to an unsustainable or disproportionate load on the store or its infrastructure.</p>
        
        <p>The customer is prohibited from posting or uploading any defamatory, offensive, infringing, harmful, threatening, abusive, tortuous, or racist materials, or morally inappropriate or otherwise unlawful content or information.</p>
        
        <p>The customer is prohibited from unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized access to the store or granting others permission to use their account, impersonating any person, or misrepresenting membership with another person. The customer is liable for the consequences of violating the provisions of this paragraph.</p>
        
        <p>The customer is prohibited from taking any action that could damage or conflict with the intellectual property rights of the store or Dkhoun Emirates Company.</p>
        
        <p>The customer is prohibited from uploading or attaching any files, programs, or other materials protected by intellectual property laws or any private or public rights that they do not have the right to use.</p>
        
        <p>If the Company determines, in its personal discretion, that the customer has violated any of these conditions, it has the right to delete the customer's account, suspend or restrict access, or prevent the customer from using the store. The Company has the right to report the customer to Internet service providers or the competent authorities or take any legal action.</p>
        
        <h2>Third: Provisions for Benefiting from the Store</h2>
        <p>The Company displays in the store perfume products, incense, and any other products that it manufactures specifically in the name of the Company, or products that it imports or purchases and then displays in the store for sale to customers.</p>
        
        <p>The products are displayed in the store, and their display includes a picture of the product, an approximate description of it, and the financial value. We emphasize that we strive for accuracy as much as possible in the description of the product and its displayed image, but we do not guarantee the conformity of the descriptions or images to the reality of the product. An error or inaccuracy may occur in them, and this clarification is to confirm to the customer that the differences that may occur in the description of the product or its displayed image do not mean the Company's shortcoming or commission of any violations, or its bearing any responsibilities for those differences in the description of the product and its displayed images.</p>
        
        <p>Products are purchased by placing them in the cart inside the store and then paying the value of the products and delivery fees specified in the purchase completion steps, which will be estimated based on the determination of the Company or shipping companies contracted with it for the value of delivery according to the delivery location chosen by the customer.</p>
        
        <p>The customer undertakes to exercise complete accuracy and enter correct information for communication with them and for the location to which the products will be delivered. In the event of any error in the information entered by the customer, the store will not bear any responsibility for the failure to deliver the products or the delay in delivery, or the delivery of the products to another party other than the customer based on the incorrect information entered by the customer. The customer acknowledges that they are not entitled to any claims or compensation from the store.</p>
        
        <p>Delivery of products to the customer within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will take (between 3 to 15 days), and delivery of products to the customer outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will take (between 3 to 30 days). The delivery times may increase during peak seasons such as (holidays - national and social events - times of offers and discounts - and other seasons in which demand rates rise in a way that affects the delivery date). The store will not be liable for any delay in delivery during peak seasons, and the customer will not have the right to cancel the order or refund the amounts paid due to the delay in delivery.</p>
        
        <p>The product delivery process is carried out through independent shipping companies contracted by the store. Therefore, any problems that may occur on the products, in the delivery, or in anything related to the sales process that took place with the customer due to the shipping company will be responsible in the face of the customer, and the store will not bear any responsibilities towards the customer.</p>
        
        <p>The customer acknowledges that their receipt of the products from the shipping company and the departure of the shipping company or its representative from the delivery location is an acknowledgment from them of receiving all the products that were requested according to the description on which the purchase was based, as well as acknowledging the safety of the products, their packaging, and anything related to them. They also acknowledge that the store has fulfilled all its obligations and responsibilities that it has contracted for.</p>
        
        <p>In the event that the product is returned by the shipping company due to the customer's failure to respond to the shipping company or the delivery representative in receiving the product, the customer will bear the payment of other delivery fees that may differ from the previous fees to re-deliver the product again.</p>
        
        <p>The store will not have any responsibilities or obligations towards the customer after they receive the products from the shipping company.</p>
        
        <p>There may be errors in the prices of products displayed on the store. If the customer makes a purchase of any of the products at the wrong price, the customer will be notified of the error and will have to complete the difference between the amount paid and the amount required for the value of the product to complete the sales and delivery process. They also have the right not to complete the purchase and request a refund of the amount paid. In any case, the store will not be obligated to complete the sales process and deliver the products in the event of an error in the specified price, even if the customer has completed paying the amount specified in error in the store.</p>
        
        <p>The approved currency for pricing products is (Saudi Riyal). Therefore, the prices that will appear in the store for other currencies are based on the exchange rate for the Saudi Riyal at that moment. In any case, the approved reference for determining the price of products will be the Saudi Riyal, and the prices that appear in the store in other currencies will not have any effect in the event of errors in them or differences in the conversion, and the store has the right to refuse to deal in any currencies other than the Saudi Riyal in purchasing processes.</p>
        
        <p>Requesting the product and paying its value by the customer does not mean the conclusion of the purchase process from a legal and Sharia point of view. The completion of the sale and its conclusion is by starting the product delivery procedure - after the customer pays its value - whether by handing it over to the shipping company or to the delivery department of the company. This means that the store has the right not to complete the sales contract for the customer or to modify the details of the sale, the value of the products, and the value of the delivery at any time before starting the procedure for shipping the products and handing them over to the shipping company, even if the customer has paid the value of the product.</p>
        
        <p>The products displayed in the store comply with the conditions and specifications approved by the official authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the customer alone is responsible for verifying their own suitability, their medical suitability, and the suitability of their dependents in using the products. The Company does not bear any responsibilities towards what the customer is exposed to from health problems, diseases, allergies, etc. due to the products, or for its violation of the specifications and standards of any country other than the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, even if the customer's headquarters are there.</p>
        
        <p>The customer acknowledges that when purchasing the products, they rely on their desire to purchase and their assessment of the suitability of the products and their prices for them and do not rely on any evaluations that appear in the store or in any other site for the products, nor on any promotional or marketing methods for the products. Therefore, the customer is not entitled in any case to claim that they have been exposed to deception or ignorance after completing the purchase of any products from the store.</p>
        
        <p>The customer bears any fees, taxes, or expenses that appear or are imposed by any party before, during, or after the approval of the purchase and payment process.</p>
        
        <p>The store has the right, for any reason whatsoever, to suspend, delete, or stop the customer's account without the need to provide any justification to the customer.</p>
        
        <p>Issuing the invoice and delivering the products to the customer does not mean that they have fulfilled their obligations to pay the value of the product, delivery fees, and any other fees. To prove payment, they must show the bank documents that prove the deposit or payment of the amounts due to the Company in one of its bank accounts, and nothing else will be accepted to prove the customer's performance of their obligations.</p>
        
        <p>The store does not bear any responsibilities or costs for any damages or losses of any kind or anything else that occurs to the customer and their property due to the products.</p>
        
        <p>The customer is committed to all the provisions and conditions of this agreement. In the event of their violation of any of what is stated in it, they are obligated to compensate the store and the Company the necessary compensation that covers the damage caused to them, including, but not limited to (the costs of damages - losses - lost profits - etc.).</p>
        
        <p>The store will not have any responsibilities for its breach of any of its obligations due to force majeure circumstances that are beyond the control of either party.</p>
        
        <p>The store has the right at any time and without the need to provide justification and for any reason whatsoever, whether due to the inability to deliver, or the product running out, or any other reason, to cancel the customer's order and return the value paid by them.</p>
        
        <p>In the event that the store breaches any of its obligations in the agreement or breaches any of the customer's rights or any other obligations, requirements, or instructions imposed on it, the compensation due to the customer is limited only to (replacing the product for the customer with a new product if available) or (by returning the amount of the product and the delivery fees paid by the customer). The store will not have any obligation for any other compensation other than what is mentioned, and the customer acknowledges their agreement to that, and that this is an acknowledgment from them and a commitment and waiver of any compensation requests they make from the store that exceed what is mentioned in this clause.</p>
        
        <p>In the event that the customer violates their obligations or any of what is stated in this agreement or manipulates or abuses the store or the Company or does not pay the value of the products or any financial dues owed by them to the store or the Company, and this results in the demand being directed to the competent authorities, the customer will be responsible for compensating the Company for the costs and attorneys' fees and any other costs that the Company may incur in order to obtain its demand. They are also obligated to compensate it for all the damages that occurred to it due to their action, including lost profits.</p>
        
        <p>Customs fees are imposed if the order is international.</p>
        
        <p>The customer acknowledges and undertakes that their purchase of the products listed in the electronic invoice is for personal use only and they do not have the right to resell them for the purpose of trade and profit. In the event of a violation of this condition, they are obligated to compensate Dkhoun Emirates Company for the damages resulting from that by a compensation amount of no less than 50,000 fifty thousand riyals.</p>
        
        <p>Please note that shipping to the State of Kuwait and the Kingdom of Bahrain is subject to customs fees borne by the customer.</p>
